# Crowdfunding_ETL

**Introduction**

The objective of this project is to perform Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) operations on crowdfunding data using a combination of Python and SQL. The process involves utilizing Pandas and Python for extracting and transforming raw data, while PostgreSQL and pgAdmin serve as the platforms for loading the cleaned data, making it analysis-ready.

By seamlessly integrating Python and SQL tools, this ETL pipeline ensures that the crowdfunding data is not only extracted and transformed accurately but is also efficiently loaded into a database, setting the stage for meaningful analysis and exploration.

**Conclusion**

The data analysis underscores the prominence of "theater," "film & video," and "music" as the most thriving crowdfunding categories, characterized by consistently high success rates. Conversely, "journalism" and "games" exhibit comparatively lower success rates within the crowdfunding landscape. Further examination reveals that certain subcategories, such as "plays," "photography books," "web," "food trucks," and "wearables," enjoy heightened success, while others like "audio," "science fiction," and "world music" face more challenging prospects.
